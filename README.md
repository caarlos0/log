## Acknowledgements

This package is a very refactored version of the great [apex/log][1].

Changes are mostly related to reducing the number of dependencies and removing things I don't use,
focusing in using it as CLI pretty logger, mainly for [GoReleaser][2].

Make sure to check out the [original work by tj][1]!
